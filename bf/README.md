# Brainf*ck
    This is the one of the most esoteric programming language developed by Urban Muller in 1993. It consist of eight(8) commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. The commands are:
* **> - Increment the data pointer**
* **< - Decrement the data pointer**
* **+ - Increment the byte at the data pointer**
* **- - Decrememt the byte at the data pointer**
* **. - Output the byte at the data pointer**
* **, - Accept one byte of input, storing the value at the data pointer**
* **[ - Used in looping(condition depends on the value of the data pointer, start loop)**
* **] - Also used in looping (condition depends on the value of the data pointer, end loop)**
